# Misc. Futhark fun

Futhark: http://futhark-lang.org/ and
https://github.com/HIPERFIT/futhark


## futcam.py

Depends on OpenCV 2 and PyGame.  Run `make` to build the library.

Run Futhark code on a live webcam feed!

Currently defaults to fish-eye-like filter.  Adjust the distortion by
pressing the up and down arrow keys.
